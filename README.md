#### This is the code the Project3 of the Udacity Cloud DevOps NanoDegree
#### I've cerated using terraform 0.12.6 - which is the latest version at the time of writing


The code will spin up CI infrastructure which will consist of a Jenkins Server and surrounding AWS infrastructure (VPC, SecGroups, ALB and so on...)

Prerequisites:
- AWS account
- Pre-created S3 bucket to store your Terraform state (just create a new S3 Bucket and give it a decent name for your project)
